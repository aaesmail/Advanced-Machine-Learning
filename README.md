# Advanced-Machine-Learning
All the notebooks that I implemented in the advanced machine learning course

1. Logistic Regression:
  * Implemented logistic regression algorithm from scratch using numpy only and matplotlib for visualizations
  * Implemented gradient descent and implemented some modifications on it like stochastic, momentum and RMSprop

2. MNIST data set classification:
  * Used Tensorflow computation graphs to implement it
  * Used logistic regression to classify it with just a linear model
  * Next used a 2 hidden layer Multi-Layer-Perceptron to calssify it
