# Advanced-Machine-Learning
All the notebooks that I implemented in the advanced machine learning course

* Logistic Regression:
  * Implemented logistic regression algorithm from scratch using numpy only and matplotlib for visualizations
  * Implemented gradient descent and implemented some modifications on it like stochastic, momentum and RMSprop
